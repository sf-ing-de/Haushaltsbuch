# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application named 'haushaltsbuch' developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, and Vite.js as the build tool.

- **Key Technologies**: Vue.js, Vite.js
- **Architecture**: Modular component-based structure using Vue components.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd haushaltsbuch`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Basic Usage
- To start the development server: `npm run dev`
- To build the application for production: `npm run build`
- To preview the build: `npm run preview`

## Running Tests
- Ensure you have the necessary testing frameworks installed.
- Add npm scripts to run tests as needed.

# Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains main application components and logic.
- **public/**: Static assets like icons and images.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration file for Vite.
- **package.json**: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

# Development Workflow

- **Coding Standards**: Follow Vue.js best practices and conventions.
- **Testing Approach**: Integrate with testing libraries like Jest or Mocha as needed.
- **Build and Deployment**: Uses Vite scripts for building and deploying the application.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Document contributing.md according to project-specific practices.

# Key Concepts

- **Vue Components**: Understand the component lifecycle, state management, and template structures.
- **Vite Plugins**: Usage of plugins like `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and `vite-plugin-vue-devtools` to enhance development.

# Common Tasks

- **Adding a New Component**: Create a `.vue` file in the `src/components` directory and import it into `src/App.vue` or other parent components.
- **Configuring Vite**: Modify `vite.config.js` to add or adjust plugins and settings.

# Troubleshooting
